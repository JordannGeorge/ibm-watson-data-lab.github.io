Offline First is about handling unreliable networks with grace. A natural extension of Responsive web design and Mobile First thinking &mdash; which treat screen size as a design constraint &mdash; Offline First is an approach to building apps that accounts for data access in the absence of network connectivity. As a design concept, it's also a welcoming community where all contributors, vendors and partners are welcome.
