- title:    How I used serverless infrastructure to build a large-scale petition system
  headline: An example web app using OpenWhisk and Cloudant.
  story:    “Serverless” means that instead of having fixed numbers of dedicated machines sitting in data centres waiting for traffic to come in, we can supply the code that handles a single piece of work (e.g. the submission of a web form) to an application framework like IBM OpenWhisk and let it scale out the computing power required. If no traffic arrives, you don’t pay anything — no fixed costs!

There is an app store for such skills, but even if you want to add functionality to your own Dot, then you can use the same APIs without publishing your code to the app store.
